# AccountApi
A basic Go Web API that is designed with processing simple account operations such as login and resetting passwords. The aim of this project was to familiarise myself with writing Go as a language, learn about handling HTTP rest calls and managing interface injection in order to make a unit-testable code base.

To run the API and/or view the API documentation:
```bash
cd $PATH
git clone https://github.com/KrylixZA/AccountApi.git
cd AccountApi/src
go build
./src
```

> To view the API documentation, browse to http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html
> To test the API, import the postman collection from https://github.com/KrylixZA/AccountApi/tree/master/postman into Postman and send the requests.
